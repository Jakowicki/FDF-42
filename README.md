# FDF Project 🌄
FDF is a wireframe model viewer implemented in C, which uses the MiniLibX library for graphical rendering. This project allows you to visualize 3D maps from 2D representations.

## Project Overview 🌟
Welcome to the FDF Project! This project converts 2D height maps into 3D wireframe models, allowing you to explore and manipulate the visual representation of terrain data.

## Introduction 📖
The FDF Project involves creating a 3D wireframe viewer for visualizing height maps. This project helps improve your understanding of graphical rendering, coordinate transformations, and user interactions in C programming.

## Features 🌟
3D Wireframe Rendering: Convert 2D maps into interactive 3D models.
Rotation and Scaling: Manipulate the view of the 3D model with rotation and scaling.

Custom Colors: 
-
- Apply custom colors to enhance visual representation.
## Setup and Installation ⚙️
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jakowicki/FDF-42.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
-
```sh
cd fdf
```
Compile the project:
-
```sh
make
```
## Usage 🚀
Run the program with a map file:
-
```sh
./fdf path_to_map_folder/map.fdf
```
Use the keyboard and mouse to interact with the 3D model:
-
- QWEASD keys: Rotate the model.
- SCROLL: Zoom in and out.
- Left Click: Move around.
- R key: Reset view.
- P key: Paralel view.
- -/+ keys: Adjust the altitude.
